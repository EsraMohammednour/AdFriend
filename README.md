AdFriend - Motivational Ad Blocker
Introduction
AdFriend is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by replacing intrusive advertisements with uplifting and motivational messages. Instead of being bombarded by ads, you'll see positive affirmations that encourage and inspire you throughout your day. Whether you're working, studying, or just browsing the web, AdFriend helps you stay focused and motivated.

The extension identifies common ad elements on web pages (such as banners, iframes, and containers with ad-related classes or IDs) and replaces them with randomly selected motivational quotes. Each message includes a close button, allowing you to remove it manually, and automatically fades out after 15 seconds.
